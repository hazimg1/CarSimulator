# How long time did you end up spending on this coding test?
 I ended up spending approximately 9 to 10 hours on this coding test.

# Explain why you chose the code structure you used in your solution?

The code structure I used in the solution was chosen to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Here are the key reasons for the chosen structure:

## 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Interfaces**: Defined interfaces (`ICarEvent`, `ICommand`, `ICommandProcessor`, `IValidator`, `IIOHelper`) to separate the contract from the implementation. This allows for easier testing and swapping of implementations without affecting the rest of the code.
- **Commands**: Implemented command classes (`MoveForwardCommand`, `MoveBackwardCommand`, `TurnLeftCommand`, `TurnRightCommand`) to encapsulate the actions that can be performed by the car. This follows the Command Pattern, making it easy to add new commands in the future.
- **Events**: Used event classes (`CarMovedEventArgs`, `CarTurnedEventArgs`) to handle car movement and turning events. This decouples the event handling logic from the main car logic.

## 2. Modularity
- **Helper Classes**: Created helper classes (`IOHelper`, `LogHelper`, `LoggerDefinitions`) to handle specific tasks like input/output operations and logging. This keeps the main logic clean and focused on its primary responsibilities.
- **Extensions**: Added extension methods (`DirectionsExtension`) to enhance the functionality of existing types without modifying their source code. This promotes code reuse and cleaner syntax.

## 3. Dependency Injection
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Configured DI in the main program to manage dependencies. This improves testability and flexibility by allowing dependencies to be injected rather than hard-coded.
- **Service Configuration**: Registered services like `IIOHelper`, `ICommandProcessor`, `ICarEvent`, and `IValidator` in the DI container. This ensures that the correct implementations are used throughout the application.

## 4. Asynchronous Programming
- **Async Methods**: Used asynchronous methods (`AddCommandAsync`, `ExecuteCommandsAsync`, `GetRoomInputAsync`, `GetCarInputAsync`, `GetActionCommandsAsync`) to improve the responsiveness of the application. This is particularly important for I/O-bound operations.

## 5. Error Handling
- **Exception Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling in the simulator to manage known exceptions (`FormatException`, `ArgumentException`) and unexpected errors. This ensures that the application can gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to the user.

## 6. Logging
- **Logging**: Used logging extensively to track the flow of the application and capture important events. This aids in debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.

## 7. Testability
- **Unit Tests**: Structured the code to facilitate unit testing. For example, by using interfaces and dependency injection, it becomes easier to mock dependencies and write tests for individual components.
- **Test Coverage**: Added unit tests for commands, helper classes, and extensions to ensure that each component behaves as expected.

## 8. Scalability
- **Scalable Design**: Designed the system to be easily extendable. For example, new commands can be added without modifying existing code, and new event types can be introduced with minimal changes.

By following these principles, the code structure ensures that the solution is robust, easy to maintain, and adaptable to future requirements.


# What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

If I had more time to work on the solution, I would consider adding the following enhancements:

## 1. Enhanced User Interface
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Implement a GUI to make the simulator more user-friendly and visually appealing. This could include visual representations of the car’s movements and the room layout.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a web-based interface using frameworks like Blazor to allow users to interact with the simulator through a browser.

## 2. Advanced Command Handling
- **Command History**: Implement a feature to track and display the history of executed commands, allowing users to review and possibly undo actions.

## 3. Improved Error Handling and Validation
- **Detailed Error Messages**: Provide more detailed and user-friendly error messages to help users understand and correct their input errors.
- **Input Validation**: Enhance input validation to handle a wider range of edge cases and provide real-time feedback to users.

## 4. Performance Optimization
- **Concurrency**: Optimize the simulator to handle multiple cars simultaneously, using concurrency and parallel processing techniques.
- **Performance Metrics**: Implement performance metrics to monitor and optimize the simulator’s efficiency, especially under high load conditions.

## 5. Additional Features
- **Obstacle Handling**: Introduce obstacles within the room that the car must navigate around, adding complexity and realism to the simulation.
- **Multiple Car Support**: Extend the simulator to support multiple cars, each with its own set of commands and events.
- **Customizable Room Layouts**: Allow users to define custom room layouts with varying dimensions and obstacles.
- **Flexible Rotation**: Implement the ability for the car to rotate by angles other than 90 degrees, providing more precise control over its movements.
- **Realistic Center of Rotation**: Ensure that the car's center of rotation mimics that of a real car, enhancing the realism of the simulation.

## 6. Documentation and Tutorials
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation for the simulator, including setup instructions, usage guides, and API references.
- **Tutorials and Examples**: Create tutorials and example scenarios to help users get started with the simulator and understand its capabilities.

## 7. Enhanced Logging and Monitoring
- **Advanced Logging**: Implement advanced logging features to capture more detailed information about the simulator’s operations and user interactions.
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Develop a monitoring dashboard to visualize the simulator’s performance metrics and logs in real-time.

By incorporating these enhancements, the solution would become more robust, user-friendly, and feature-rich, providing a better overall experience for users.
